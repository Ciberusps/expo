### What does Feature Preview mean?

We decided to publish some of our new features as a preview to get feedback from you. It doesn't mean that those functionalities are in the "beta". As developers, we are skeptical of relying on anything labeled a "beta", knowing it is sometimes applied to projects that are early in development, incomplete, or may not receive long-term support. Expo offers you tested and adapted by many teams solutions to help you with day-to-day work. The main reason why those features were published as a preview is to hear your feedback to make them better. We treat that period as a time to decided what developers expected from our services. Preview also means that we expect to need to make breaking changes in those packages.
